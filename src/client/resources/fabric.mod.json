	"description": "Ever since Mojang updated their command framework to Brigadier, commands are case sensitive. If you are as incompetent as me, you will hold the SHIFT key for too long when typing / and thus causing the next letters to be capital too. Which breaks the command execution and tab completion. This mod forces commands (not subcommands), to be lower cased.",
